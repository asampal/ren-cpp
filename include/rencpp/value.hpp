// Abstractly speaking the runtime is a "separate thing" from the basic type
// list (which would be more akin to "Ren"):
//
//    https://github.com/humanistic/REN
//
// So a bare-bones interface could be made where the values themselves were
// "dead data"...and you always had to pass them to the appropriate
// runtime service.  While it might make the architectural lines a bit more
// rigid, it's lame because you couldn't do something like:
//
//     auto print = ren::Word("print");
//     print(10 + 20);
//
// So some of the runtime ideas like "Engine" and "Context" have leaked in
// for various parameterizations.  Yet they are only defined by pointers that
// default to null in the interface; a given RenCpp implementation could
// throw errors if they were ever non-null.

// into that cell.  This helps avoid RTTI or virtual dispatch and in theory
// the reason templates can be parameterized with functions has to do with
// inlining and optimization...so it might be about the fastest way to do it.
//
// The helper templates themselves provide the base functions to their
// specific type classes.  They provide publicly inherited functions
// but are not meant to be directly instantiated by users.  They are
// templated by the member function which can both identify and set the
// class in a cell, defined by the runtime you are using.

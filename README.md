# RenCpp

This is an experimental C++11 Language binding for the [Rebol and Red](http://blog.hostilefork.com/why-rebol-red-parse-cool/) programming languages.

This code is not "released" in any kind of formal fashion.  It is only on GitHub for review by collaborators in the initial design.  However, when released it will be targeting the Boost Software License 1.0 (BSL) 

The repository also currently includes code for the [Ren Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0exDvv5WEv4) cross-platform GUI console, based on RenCpp.  Ren Garden's C++/Qt codebase is under the GPLv3 license, with its "helper" routines (currently written in Rebol) under the BSD license.
